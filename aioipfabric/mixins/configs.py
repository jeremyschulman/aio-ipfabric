        This coroutine is used to download the latest copy of devices in the
        active snapshot.  The default behavior is to locate the lastest device
        configuration since the `since_ts` time for all devices.

        If the Caller needs to "go back in time" then both the `since_ts` and
        `before_ts` values should be used and only devices that match:

                since_ts <= lastChange <= before_ts

        If the Caller would like to further filter records based on 'hostname',
        'sn' (serial-number), those filters can be provided in the `filters`
        parameter.

        Parameters
        ----------
        since_ts:
            The timestamp criteria for retrieving configs such that lastChecked
            is >= since_ts. This value is the epoch timestamp * 1_000; which is
            the IP Fabric native storage unit for timestamps.

        all_configs:
            When False (default) this coroutine will fetech only those
            configurations that have _changed_.  Use all_configs=True when you
            want to fetch the configs regardless if they have changed or not.

        on_config:
            A coroutine that will be invoked with the device record and
            configuration file content that allows the Caller to do
            something with the content such as save it to a file.

        filters:
            Any additional Caller provided API filters that should be applied in
            addition to using the `since_ts` and `before_ts` options.  This
            filters dictionary allows the caller to be more specific, for
            example regex of hostnames.  The filters only apply to the fields to
            extact the backup record hashs; which primarily include ['sn',
            'hostname', 'status']

        device_filter:
            The Caller can optionally provide a function used to filter if the
            provided device-hash record should be used or not to retrieve the
            device configuration.  This parameter is useful for cases where the
            Caller wants to limit the device configuration retrival based on
            filtering beyond the get-hash filter fields of sn and hostname.

        before_ts:
            The timestamp criteria for retrieving configs such that lastChecked
            is <= before_ts.  This value is the epoch timestamp * 1_000.

        sanitized:
            Determines if the configuration should be santized as it is extracted
            from the IP Fabric system.

        batch_sz:
            Number of concurrent download tasks; used to rate-limit IPF API
            due to potential performance related issue.

        dry_run:
            When True this coroutine will return the list of devices
            that would be used to retrieve the configuration files; but
            not actually get the configs.

        Returns
        -------
        List of device-hash records that were used to perform the config file
        fetching process.

        Notes
        -----
        From experiments with the IP Fabric API, v3.6.1, observations are that
        batch_sz must be 1 as higher values result in result text as
        combinations of multiple devices. (Confirmed by IP Fabric engineering
        2020-Sep-09)
